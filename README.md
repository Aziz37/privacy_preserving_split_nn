# Hardware-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Multi-Channel EEG Computational Headwear

In this work, we propose a system that balances privacy preservation and computational efficiency by splitting a neural network model between the wearable device and the cloud. We introduce a Combined Privacy Metric (CPM) to quantify privacy leakage and optimize where to split the neural network to minimize data exposure. Using this method, we achieved a high seizure detection accuracy of 96.25% while enhancing privacy.
